		2999,
		'/images/bruise.jpg',
		'King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard''s Debut album.  Very garage-y and harsh',
		'Long Description'),
		('Eyes Like the Sky',
		2599,
		'/images/eyes.jpg',
		'The boys decided that their EP and debut were to garage and didn''t want to be put into a category.  This album is like a old western radio drama with evil guitars in the background.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Float Along - Fill Your Lungs',
		2379,
		'/images/float.jpg',
		'Seems like a kind of transition into Radiohead vibes that they quickly left.  Standout tracks are "Let Me Mend the Past" and "God is Calling Me Back Home"',
		'Long Description'),
		('Oddments',
		2120,
		'/images/oddments.jpg',
		'The first ''B-side''.  A collection of songs that didn''t make it to other albums.  Still mangages to maintain it''s own identity of pop-y indie vibes',
		'Long Description'),
		('I''m in Your Mind Fuzz',
		3299,
		'/images/mindfuzz.jpg',
		'Considered the best entry album to get into Gizz.  Very wild opening with a mellow ending.  You get a taste of most of their more prominent vibes.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Quarters!',
		4040,
		'/images/quarters.jpg',
		'Four tracks, each 10:10 long.  Similar vibes to the latter half of mind-fuzz.  "God is in the Rhythm" is one of Gizz''s best tracks',
		'Long Description'),
		('Paper Mâché Dream Balloon',
		3346,
		'/images/papermache.jpg',
		'A very chirpy and happy sounding album about a deranged serial killer.  Recorded on almost entirely acoustic instruments, you might not notice the haunting story at all.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Nonagon Infinity',
		9999,
		'/images/nonagon.png',
		'A nine track long album designed to be looped infinitely.  Certainly Gizz''s wildest and most energetic effort yet.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Flying Microtonal Banana',
		3500,
		'/images/microtonal.jpg',
		'The boys created a microtonal guitar for this album.  Very haunting psychedelic sitar-esque sounds here.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Murder of the Universe',
		5000,
		'/images/murder.jpg',
		'3 albums in one.  A side very fast and narration heavy.  B side reminiscent of Nonagon.  C side is a total meme.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Sketches of Brunswick East',
		3720,
		'/images/brunswick.jpg',
		'A collaboration album with Mild High Club leads to a very groovy jazz fusion sound.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Polygonwanaland',
		4000,
		'/images/polygon.jpg',
		'The most fun album name to say.  Also the most archetypically psychedelic album.  Like a bad trip with a good afterglow',
		'Long Description'),
		('Gumboot Soup',
		4408,
		'images/gumboot.jpg',
		'The second of the B side albums.  This one is much more varied and you can really hear which album''s recording sesh a song came from.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Fishing for Fishies',
		4156,
		'images/fishies.png',
		'A very pop-y sounding environmental jam protesting overfishing and plastics.',
		'Long Description'),
		('Infest the Rats Nest',
		3450,
		'images/infest.jpg',
		'Straight up thrash metal out of nowhere.  Tells the story of an environmental apocalypse and a group of astronauts trying to escape to the planet venus',
		'Long Description')
